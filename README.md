## Task Details

### OTP Form

- **Empty Form State:** A form to input a 4-digit OTP.
- **Filling State:** The state during the input of the OTP.
- **Filled State (Success):** The state when the OTP is correctly filled (1234 is VALID OTP).
- **Filled State (Error):** The state when the OTP is incorrectly filled.

### Drag and Drop Course Cards

- Implement a list of vertical course cards using any drag-and-drop library of your choice.
- Each card should have actions for "Move to Top," "Move to Bottom," and "Remove."

### Data Table

- Create a paginated table listing batches of a course and their statuses.
- Include a search option to filter the batches.

## Routing

All three assignments are completed inside a single React project under different URL routes for the three tasks respectively:

- `/otp-form`: OTP Form
- `/course-list`: Drag and Drop Course Cards
- `/batches`: Data Table

The base URL `/` redirects to `/otp-form`.

## Branding Logo

The branding logo is positioned in the bottom right corner for all tasks. Clicking this logo opens the "chaicode.com" website.
